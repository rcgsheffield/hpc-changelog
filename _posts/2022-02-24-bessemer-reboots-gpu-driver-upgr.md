Two GPU nodes in Bessemer have been unexpectedly rebooting over the last few weeks.  A common factor is the GPU driver software, where we've been using a particular version over the period where we've been experiencing random reboots of those two nodes.  The GPU driver on those two nodes has now been upgraded to see if this will prevent further random reboots, and those two nodes has been returned to service.  However, for the next couple of weeks you should assume that those two nodes are at risk.
