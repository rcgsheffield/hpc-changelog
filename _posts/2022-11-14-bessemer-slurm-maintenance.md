An update is required for the Slurm scheduler  (from version 22.05.5 to 22.05.6) on Bessemer. This maintenance is scheduled for Monday the 14th of November between 11:00 to 12:00.

This should be non-disruptive but if you wish, you can hold and release your queued jobs with:

    scontrol hold <job ID> 

    scontrol release <job ID>

If you have any questions about the above or the maintenance work in general please get in touch with us via [research-it@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:research-it@sheffield.ac.uk?subject=RE:Bessemer Slurm update November 14th (maintenance work)).
