An update is required for the storage controllers, Lustre clients and Lustre servers underpinning of the fastdata filestorage area on the Bessemer HPC system. The /fastdata area (Lustre filesystem) on Bessemer will be unavailable on Thursday the 1st of September from 09:00 to 17:00.

Please be aware that:
 - Any jobs using /fastdata at 09:00 on the 1st of September will be terminated.
 - Any processes on login nodes using /fastdata at that time will also be terminated.
 - Bessemer will be accessible and usable throughout this maintenance period for those that don't need access to /fastdata then.

If you have any questions about the above or the maintenance work in general please get in touch with us via [research-it@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:research-it@sheffield.ac.uk?subject=RE:Bessemer fastdata file store at risk on the September 1st (maintenance work)).
