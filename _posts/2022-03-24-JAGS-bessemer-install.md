The software JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) has been installed on Bessemer.
It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.

The documentation for the usage of this software can now be found at: [https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/JAGS.html](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/JAGS.html)
