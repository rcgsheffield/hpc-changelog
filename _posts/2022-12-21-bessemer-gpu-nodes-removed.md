Between May and December 2022, 16 addtional GPU nodes were (temporarily) available to all users of Bessemer.  
These featured NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which were quite a bit faster than the (older generation) V100 GPUs in Bessemer.

These have now been removed from Bessemer and will be available in the University's new HPC cluster, Stanage, early in 2023.
