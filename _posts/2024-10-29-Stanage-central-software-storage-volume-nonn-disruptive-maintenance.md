The storage volume used to provide the centrally provided software for users on Stanage is nearly full. Maintenance work to increase the capacity of this area is scheduled for **November 5th between 10am and 11:30am**.

This work is atypical and is expected to be non-disruptive to users and jobs on the cluster. Even so, during this period all jobs and interactive sessions using centrally provided software on Stanage should be considered at risk.
