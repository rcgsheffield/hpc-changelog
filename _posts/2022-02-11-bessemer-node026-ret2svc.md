bessemer-node026, the sole public GPU node in Bessemer, has been unavailable for a couple of weeks due to a hardware fault (random reboots).  Following the replacement of a part the node has now been returned to service, but it will be a couple of weeks before we can be confident that the original problem will not recur.
