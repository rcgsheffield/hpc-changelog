Newer Git modules for both the ShARC and Bessemer cluster have been added and older modules have been depreciated due to various vulnerabilities.

Git can now be loaded on ShARC with:

>```module load dev/git/2.39.1/gcc-4.9.4```  

Git can now be loaded on Bessemer with:

>```module load git/2.39.1-GCCcore-10.3.0-nodocs ```.
