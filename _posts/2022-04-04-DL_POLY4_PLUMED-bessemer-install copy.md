The software DL_POLY4 (v5.0.0), a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software has been installed on Bessemer. DL_POLY4 has been interfaced with the PLUMED (v2.3.2) package,
an open-source, community-developed library that provides a wide range of different methods, which include:

- enhanced-sampling algorithms
- free-energy methods
- tools to analyze the vast amounts of data produced by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

The documentation for the usage of the DL_POLY4 software can now be found at: [https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/DL_POLY_4.html](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/DL_POLY_4.html)

The documentation for the usage of the PLUMED software can now be found at: [https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/PLUMED.html](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/bessemer/software/apps/PLUMED.html)
