We are excited to announce a major update to the HPC documentation:
the launch of the All Package Index for the Stanage Software pages. 

This comprehensive index includes all packages installed on Stanage, with content generated automatically.
It is updated regularly to reflect the latest installations and mirrors the full range of packages available on Stanage.

Each package entry includes minimal documentation, providing key details such as descriptions,
version information, dependencies for the latest version, URLs, and build log locations.
