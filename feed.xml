Access to and use of the Bessemer HPC cluster will not be affected by this work, neither will direct user access to research storage areas via CIFS/SMB clients.</p>

<p>The data migration work is scheduled to take place between 09:00 to 12:00 on that day but all user activity on the cluster should cease before then and you should assume that the cluster won’t be usable earlier in the day on 5th July.  We’ll update users via hpc-announce@sheffield.ac.uk once the work is complete and should there be any delays.</p>

<p>Any user activity on the cluster at 09:00 of 5th July will be terminated including: SSH sessions on login nodes, interactive and batch jobs on worker nodes, interactive JupyterHub and myApps/SGD sessions, periodic jobs and file transfers to/from the cluster (via SCP/rsync).  During the maintenance period users will not be able to SSH to the login nodes, copy files to/from the cluster via SCP/rsync, run JupyterHub sessions or run myApps sessions.</p>

<p>Job queues will be automatically disabled to prevent the submission of new jobs after 00:00 on 5th July.  Any jobs submitted in the few days before that will remain queued and won’t run until after the maintenance period if the job scheduler (SGE) thinks the jobs require more run time than is available before 00:00 on 5th July.  Don’t forget that you can explicitly specify the amount of run time you want per job on ShARC using the <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/scheduler/index.html#batch-jobs">SGE parameter ‘-l h_rt’</a></p>

There are a number of private GPUs node in Bessemer and ShARC and the private GPU nodes in Bessemer can be used by all users if they’re willing to tolerate <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/scheduler/index.html#preemptable-jobs">jobs being abruptly terminated</a>, but this isn’t a constraint all researchers can work with and having more GPUs available to the UoS research community would be a good thing.</p>

<p>We’re therefore pleased to announce that we’re to greatly increase the number of GPUs available in UoS HPC systems by temporarily adding 16 GPU nodes, each with 4x NVIDIA A100 GPUs, to the Bessemer HPC system; and these will be available to all users. Note that these nodes will be relocated into what will be our next big HPC system in a few months’ time (there’ll be more info on that HPC system in due course).</p>

<p>Peter Heywood and Robert Chisholm in the Research Software Engineering team have done some performance comparisons with the <a href="https://flamegpu.com/">FLAME GPU 2</a> research software between these A100 nodes and the existing V100 nodes in Bessemer. They found that even for a memory-latency (and memory-bandwidth) -bound problem that the nodes featuring newer-generation A100 GPUs were significantly faster than the V100 nodes under CUDA 11!</p>

<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>These nodes are being provided in Bessemer on a temporary basis.</li>
  <li>They can be used for interactive work and for batch jobs (but please submit batch jobs where possible)</li>
  <li>Much of the software centrally provided on Bessemer is incompatible with these nodes as they have a different CPU ‘microarchitecture’ to the majority of nodes in Bessemer.</li>
  <li>Some software is centrally-provided specifically for use on these nodes.</li>
  <li>But it’s currently quite a limited set and will most likely not be expanded on much until the nodes are relocated into our next big HPC system in a few months’ time.</li>
  <li>There are a few things to be aware of if migrating workflows to these nodes, which we’ve tried to document.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on these nodes including specifications, access information and warnings/gotchas regarding software performance and compatibility please see:</p>
