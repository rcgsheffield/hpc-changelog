the launch of the All Package Index for the Stanage Software pages.</p>

<p>This comprehensive index includes all packages installed on Stanage, with content generated automatically.
It is updated regularly to reflect the latest installations and mirrors the full range of packages available on Stanage.</p>

<p>Each package entry includes minimal documentation, providing key details such as descriptions,
version information, dependencies for the latest version, URLs, and build log locations.</p>

<p>When users connect to Stanage they will now be prompted via a push notification to their DUO device to approve access or must enter a one-time code from their University provided hardware token which is associated with their DUO account.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users connecting from workers nodes back to the login nodes may see a warning due to the now changed host key fingerprints. Users should check / amend such that their SSH client expects and gets the correct host key fingerprints as per: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints</a> (i.e. amend their .ssh/known_hosts file).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users making use of Filezilla will now need to follow the same instructions as required for the Bessemer cluster to avoid being prompted by MFA multiple times while transferring files: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa</a></p>

<p><strong>At risk period for Bessemer:</strong></p>

<p>From 9am on July 15th until 5pm on July 19th.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for this work</strong></p>

<p>The operating system for Bessemer is reaching the end of its life, but we have purchased extended user support for its remaining lifespan. Accessing this extended user support requires us to apply new licences to the HPC.</p>

<p>This maintenance should be non-disruptive and no actions are required from users of the cluster.</p>

<p>Note: As this will be brief network disruption, users may experience little to no outages or disruption when connecting via SSH / transferring files however, you may experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hung/terminated SSH sessions to login nodes.</li>
  <li>Hung/terminated SCP/SFTP/rsync file transfers to/from login nodes (although rsync may be able to resume from where it left off if then (re)invoked in the right way.)</li>
  <li>Hung access to / file transfers to/from ‘/shared’ storage areas on Stanage login nodes and Bessemer login and worker nodes (depending on which /shared area you’re accessing).  These connections should automatically resume without the need for any intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your jobs require access to Sheffield remote shared storage or require network access to start up correctly, you should hold your jobs during the maintenance period, then release them after the maintenance with the following commands for specific job IDs:</p>
