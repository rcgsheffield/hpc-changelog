This maintenance is scheduled for February 13, 2025, between 11:00 to 13:00.</p>

<p>While this is a significant upgrade from 23.02.7 to 24.05.5, we do not anticipate any long-term disruption to users nor any major changes to SLURM behaviour.  However, there will be very brief periods of command unavailability during the upgrade process.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>sacct</strong> commands and other commands querying the Slurm database:
    <ul>
      <li>When the SLURM database service is restarting, these commands may get stuck or fail to complete.</li>
      <li>This part of the upgrade will take approximately 60 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>sbatch</strong> job submissions and <strong>sstat</strong> commands and other commands querying the Slurm controllers:
    <ul>
      <li>When the SLURM controllers are restarting, these commands may get stuck or fail to complete.</li>
      <li>This part of the upgrade will take approximately 10 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When this maintenance is complete we will be in contact to confirm this is the case.</p>

<p>This maintenance has been organised under change ID: C2502 072</p>

the launch of the All Package Index for the Stanage Software pages.</p>

<p>This comprehensive index includes all packages installed on Stanage, with content generated automatically.
It is updated regularly to reflect the latest installations and mirrors the full range of packages available on Stanage.</p>

<p>Each package entry includes minimal documentation, providing key details such as descriptions,
version information, dependencies for the latest version, URLs, and build log locations.</p>

<p>When users connect to Stanage they will now be prompted via a push notification to their DUO device to approve access or must enter a one-time code from their University provided hardware token which is associated with their DUO account.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users connecting from workers nodes back to the login nodes may see a warning due to the now changed host key fingerprints. Users should check / amend such that their SSH client expects and gets the correct host key fingerprints as per: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints</a> (i.e. amend their .ssh/known_hosts file).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users making use of Filezilla will now need to follow the same instructions as required for the Bessemer cluster to avoid being prompted by MFA multiple times while transferring files: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa</a></p>

<p><strong>At risk period for Bessemer:</strong></p>

<p>From 9am on July 15th until 5pm on July 19th.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for this work</strong></p>

<p>The operating system for Bessemer is reaching the end of its life, but we have purchased extended user support for its remaining lifespan. Accessing this extended user support requires us to apply new licences to the HPC.</p>

<p>This maintenance should be non-disruptive and no actions are required from users of the cluster.</p>
