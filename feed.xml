<p>When users connect to Stanage they will now be prompted via a push notification to their DUO device to approve access or must enter a one-time code from their University provided hardware token which is associated with their DUO account.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users connecting from workers nodes back to the login nodes may see a warning due to the now changed host key fingerprints. Users should check / amend such that their SSH client expects and gets the correct host key fingerprints as per: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#login-node-ssh-rsa-ecdsa-ed25519-host-key-fingerprints</a> (i.e. amend their .ssh/known_hosts file).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users making use of Filezilla will now need to follow the same instructions as required for the Bessemer cluster to avoid being prompted by MFA multiple times while transferring files: <a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa">https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/FAQs.html#problems-connecting-with-filezilla-due-to-mfa</a></p>

Bessemer will remain in service, but any jobs running on it should be considered at risk until the maintenance period is over.</p>

<p><strong>At risk period for Bessemer:</strong></p>

<p>From 9am on July 15th until 5pm on July 19th.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for this work</strong></p>

<p>The operating system for Bessemer is reaching the end of its life, but we have purchased extended user support for its remaining lifespan. Accessing this extended user support requires us to apply new licences to the HPC.</p>

<p>This maintenance should be non-disruptive and no actions are required from users of the cluster.</p>

<p>Note: As this will be brief network disruption, users may experience little to no outages or disruption when connecting via SSH / transferring files however, you may experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hung/terminated SSH sessions to login nodes.</li>
  <li>Hung/terminated SCP/SFTP/rsync file transfers to/from login nodes (although rsync may be able to resume from where it left off if then (re)invoked in the right way.)</li>
  <li>Hung access to / file transfers to/from ‘/shared’ storage areas on Stanage login nodes and Bessemer login and worker nodes (depending on which /shared area you’re accessing).  These connections should automatically resume without the need for any intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your jobs require access to Sheffield remote shared storage or require network access to start up correctly, you should hold your jobs during the maintenance period, then release them after the maintenance with the following commands for specific job IDs:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scontrol hold &lt;job ID&gt;
scontrol release &lt;job ID&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to hold and release all of your pending jobs, you can do so with the commands:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>squeue --me --noheader -t PD --format="%A" | xargs -n 1 -I {} scontrol hold {}

<p>What you need to know:</p>

<p>All Stanage login nodes and worker nodes will be unavailable over that period so you won’t be able to run jobs or transfer data during that period.</p>

<p>Leading up to the maintenance period jobs will only start if the amount of runtime they’ve requested is less than the duration until the start of the maintenance period.  e.g. if the maintenance period is to start in 48 hours time then batch jobs that request 47 hours of runtime can fit within that window and potentially be executed, depending on how busy job queues are, but jobs that request 49 hours can only be executed after the maintenance period.  The same logic applies with interactive sessions too: if you can’t start an interactive session then check that you’re requesting an appropriate amount of run time (e.g. ‘srun –time=02:30:00 –pty bash’ to start an interactive session with 2.5 hours of runtime).</p>

<p>You shouldn’t notice any changes in system behaviour following the maintenance period, although a GPU version update to driver version 525.147.05 (supporting CUDA 12.0) will take place.</p>

<p>The maintenance work should not impact data stored in home directories and /mnt/parscratch (Lustre filesystem) but please remember that neither of these areas are automatically backed up.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="New" /><category term="Stanage" /><category term="GPU" /><category term="maintenance" /><category term="outage" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A period of offline maintenance for the Stanage cluster will take place from 09:00 on 15th December to 17:00 on 19th December.]]></summary></entry></feed>
